<p>Dear @Model.getName(),</p>
<p>How are you? I hope that you are having a cold weekend. I'm vacationing in the @Model.getNoun() while I learn programming! </p>
<p>@Model.getName(), you would not @Model.getVerb() how cold it is here. I should have @Model.getVerb() to @Model.getNoun() instead.</p>
<p>But I like programming a lot, so I've got that going for me. </p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon. I'll bring you back a souvenir. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
